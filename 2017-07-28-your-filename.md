## Angular 1 vs 2 vs 4
 angular 2 is a complete rewrite of angualr 1. Angular 4 is an update on angular 2, compatable with angular 2. From version 4, the name is just Angular
 
 - Angular CLI is a set of tools that helps with creating, managaing and building Angular projects. We can also avoid CLI and do the manual way of importing to html. But using CLI takes care of a lots of things for us.
 
 - @angular/cli. '@'  is a new feature of NPM called 'scoped packages'. They effectively allow NPM packages to be namespaced - any package that starts with @angular/ will get grouped into a @angular folder in your node_modules.
The reason that scoped packages don't show up in public search is because a lot of them are private packages created by organizations using NPM's paid services, and they're not comfortable opening the search up until they can be totally certain they're not going to make anything public that shouldn't be public - from a legal perspective, this is pretty understandable.
